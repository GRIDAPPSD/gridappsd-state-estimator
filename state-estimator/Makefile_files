# Changed from -Ofast to -O2 on 7/30/20 because under an Ubuntu 20 VM with
# g++ version 9.3.0 -Ofast was giving bad numerical results in terms of
# intermittent very high Supd condition numbers and incorrect state estimates
# Then on 9/11/20, when adding the Rmat code for uncertainty based on time
# since last measurement, it happened again where it would give KLU errors
# right away every few times SE was started.  Just some very innocuous code
# adding zlast to zary and not even using it caused the issue.  So now -O
# seems to be the one that produces reliable results.  Benchmarking on the 9500
# node model shows no discernable loss in performance fortunately.
