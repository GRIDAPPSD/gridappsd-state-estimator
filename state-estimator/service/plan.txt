1. Scale up to 9500-node model via 123-bus model

2. Resolve differences between vnom angles from OpenDSS and GLD (determine vnom angles from GLD)

3. Subscribe to sensor service output rather than simulation output

4. Add other dynamic measurements such as voltage angles

5. Have plotter scubscribe to simulation output and/or sensor service output for SE validation (e.g., % error over time)

6. General code optimiation and clean-up
